            	<p>If your media isn't uploading, double check to ensure that it meets the requirements, then try again.</p>

            	<p>In some rare cases mp3 files may meet all of the requirements but still won't upload. To remedy this the file needs to be reconverted to the mp3 format. We recommend <a href="http://media.io/" target="_blank">media.io</a> or <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a> for this. The new file should now upload properly.</p>
